# Credit_Card_Driver_Prediction
A repo containing Alteryx flow and python code for predicting drivers of credit card spend and using those drivers to predict the spend

#Business Problem: 

Company collected data from 5000 customers. 

The objective of this case study is to understand what's driving the total spend of credit card(Primary Card + Secondary card), Prioritize the drivers based on the importance. This case required intensive data cleaning/preparation, Factor analysis, correlation matrix, univariate analysis and Linear Regression modeling.

-- Applied data cleaning, linear regression, filtering variables using correlations, influential observations & capturing maximum variance within data, finally listing key drivers. 
-- Prioritized drivers for credit card spending

Utilised ALteryx and Python to attempt the same problem
